Adding Posts & Pagination
Currently, when adding a new post with only one post being loaded, we end up with one post on the starting page (instead of the expected two posts).

We'll fix that later of course but you can already go ahead and make the required adjustment on your own.

We have to adjust our "add a post" code in the frontend to handle post creation and pagination correctly:

this.setState(prevState => {
    let updatedPosts = [...prevState.posts];
    if (prevState.editPost) {
        const postIndex = prevState.posts.findIndex(
            p => p._id === prevState.editPost._id
        );
        updatedPosts[postIndex] = post;
    } else {
        if (prevState.posts.length >= 2) {
            updatedPosts.pop();
        }
        updatedPosts.unshift(post);
    }
    return {
        posts: updatedPosts,
        isEditing: false,
        editPost: null,
        editLoading: false
    };
});
The following if block was added:

if (prevState.posts.length >= 2) {
    updatedPosts.pop();
}
