Versioning in package.json
When installing a package with npm install --save or --save-dev (or --save-prod, which replaces --save), you end up with entries in your package.json file, that look something like this:

"express": "^4.16.3"
What does the ^ mean?

You can learn about all available version annotations/ syntaxes here: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#versions
