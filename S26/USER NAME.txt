The User Name is Missing!
Maybe you noticed that on the frontend, the username is missing.

We'll fix that in the next modules but you can also fix it right now of course.

The reason for it missing is that I accidentally removed the populate('creator') step when fetching the post data in our controller action.

Example:

When fetching posts, this snippet:

Post.find()
    .countDocuments()
    .then(count => {
      totalItems = count;
      return Post.find()
        .skip((currentPage - 1) * perPage)
        .limit(perPage);
    })
should become

Post.find()
    .countDocuments()
    .then(count => {
      totalItems = count;
      return Post.find()
        .populate('creator')
        .skip((currentPage - 1) * perPage)
        .limit(perPage);
    })
